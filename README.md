# Time-Series-Analysis-and-Forecasting-using-Smoothing-Techniques
This project involves analyzing financial time series data, specifically using methods like Exponential Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) and Simple Exponential Smoothing to predict trends and improve decision-making. The project demonstrates:

Data preprocessing techniques, such as forward filling to handle missing data.
Implementation of EWMA manually and using built-in Python libraries.
Application of statistical smoothing models for forecasting.
Visualization and evaluation of results using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE).
